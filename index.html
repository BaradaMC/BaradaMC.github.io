      <h2>"What is Qigong?"</h2>
      <p>"Qigong can be literally translated as ‘energy work’, an integration of mind, body and spirit to improve health and well-being.
It isn’t important whether or not you believe in qi. What is important is in the effects you observe from your practice. If you believe it has an effect, it is much more likely to, but whether you believe in qi as the underlying mechanism or not is not so important as the practice itself."
